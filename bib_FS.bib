abstract = {The ecology of infectious disease in wildlife has become a pivotal theme in animal and public health. Studies of infectious disease ecology rely on robust surveillance of pathogens in reservoir hosts, often based on serology, which is the detection of specific antibodies in the blood and is used to infer infection history. However, serological data can be inaccurate for inference to infection history for a variety of reasons. Two major aspects in any serological test can substantially impact results and interpretation of antibody prevalence data: cross-reactivity and cut-off thresholds used to discriminate positive and negative reactions. Given the ubiquitous use of serology as a tool for surveillance and epidemiological modeling of wildlife diseases, it is imperative to consider the strengths and limitations of serological test methodologies and interpretation of results, particularly when using data that may affect management and policy for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in wildlife. Greater consideration of population age structure and cohort representation, serological test suitability and standardized sample collection protocols can ensure that reliable data are obtained for downstream modeling applications to characterize, and evaluate interventions for, wildlife disease systems.},

abstract = {Seasonal variations in temperature, rainfall and resource availability are ubiquitous and can exert strong pressures on population dynamics. Infectious diseases provide some of the best-studied examples of the role of seasonality in shaping population fluctuations. In this paper, we review examples from human and wildlife disease systems to illustrate the challenges inherent in understanding the mechanisms and impacts of seasonal environmental drivers. Empirical evidence points to several biologically distinct mechanisms by which seasonality can impact host-pathogen interactions, including seasonal changes in host social behaviour and contact rates, variation in encounters with infective stages in the environment, annual pulses of host births and deaths and changes in host immune defences. Mathematical models and field observations show that the strength and mechanisms of seasonality can alter the spread and persistence of infectious diseases, and that population-level responses can range from simple annual cycles to more complex multiyear fluctuations. From an applied perspective, understanding the timing and causes of seasonality offers important insights into how parasite-host systems operate, how and when parasite control measures should be applied, and how disease risks will respond to anthropogenic climate change and altered patterns of seasonality. Finally, by focusing on well-studied examples of infectious diseases, we hope to highlight general insights that are relevant to other ecological interactions.},

The general framework focuses on interactions among abiotic requirements, biotic constraints, and dispersal abilities of species as determinants of distributional areas. Disease transmission systems have key differences from other sorts of biological phenomena: Interactions among species are particularly important, interactions may be stable or unstable, abiotic conditions may be relatively less important in shaping disease distributions, and dispersal abilities may be quite variable. The ways in which these differences may influence disease transmission geography are complex; I illustrate their effects by means of worked examples regarding West Nile Virus, plague, filoviruses, and yellow fever.},

abstract = {Biological factors that influence the host range and spillover of Ebola virus (EBOV) and other filoviruses remain enigmatic. While filoviruses infect diverse mammalian cell lines, we report that cells from African straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are refractory to EBOV infection. This could be explained by a single amino acid change in the filovirus receptor, NPC1, which greatly reduces the affinity of EBOV-NPC1 interaction. We found signatures of positive selection in bat NPC1 concentrated at the virus-receptor interface, with the strongest signal at the same residue that controls EBOV infection in Eidolon helvum cells. Our work identifies NPC1 as a genetic determinant of filovirus susceptibility in bats, and suggests that some NPC1 variations reflect host adaptations to reduce filovirus replication and virulence. A single viral mutation afforded escape from receptor control, revealing a pathway for compensatory viral evolution and a potential avenue for expansion of filovirus host range in nature.},

Fruit bats may act as reservoirs of the Filoviridae. The migratory fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, is common across sub-Saharan Africa and lives in large colonies, often situated in cities. We screened sera from 262 E. helvum using indirect fluorescent tests for antibodies against EBOV subtype Zaire. We detected a seropositive bat from Accra, Ghana, and confirmed this using western blot analysis. The bat was also seropositive for Lagos bat virus, a Lyssavirus, by virus neutralization test. The bat was fitted with a radio transmitter and was last detected in Accra 13 months after release post-sampling, demonstrating long-term survival. Antibodies to filoviruses have not been previously demonstrated in E. helvum. Radio-telemetry data demonstrates long-term survival of an individual bat following exposure to viruses of families that can be highly pathogenic to other mammal species. Because E. helvum typically lives in large urban colonies and is a source of bushmeat in some regions, further studies should determine if this species forms a reservoir for EBOV from which spillover infections into the human population may occur.},

The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a known reservoir host for Marburg virus (MARV). Following infection of ERBs with MARV, virus-specific IgG antibodies are induced but rapidly wane and by 3 months post-infection the bats are seronegative. To determine whether reinfection of ERBs plays a role in MARV maintenance, we challenge groups of ERBs that were “naturally” or experimentally infected with MARV 17–24 months prior. No bats in either group exhibit evidence of MARV replication or shedding and all bats develop virus-specific secondary immune responses. This study demonstrates that infection of ERBs with MARV induces long-term protective immunity against reinfection and indicates that other factors, such as host population dynamics, drive MARV maintenance in nature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic diseases from Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus (Filoviridae) infections can be dangerous to humans because of high fatality rates and a lack of effective treatments or vaccine. Although there is evidence that wild mammals are infected by filoviruses, the biology of host-filovirus systems is notoriously poorly understood. Specifically, identifying potential reservoir species with the expected long-term coevolutionary history of filovirus infections has been intractable. Integrated elements of filoviruses could indicate a coevolutionary history with a mammalian reservoir, but integration of nonretroviral RNA viruses is thought to be nonexistent or rare for mammalian viruses (such as filoviruses) that lack reverse transcriptase and replication inside the nucleus. Here, we provide direct evidence of integrated filovirus-like elements in mammalian genomes by sequencing across host-virus gene boundaries and carrying out phylogenetic analyses. Further we test for an association between candidate reservoir status and the integration of filoviral elements and assess the previous age estimate for filoviruses of less than 10,000 years. RESULTS: Phylogenetic and sequencing evidence from gene boundaries was consistent with integration of filoviruses in mammalian genomes. We detected integrated filovirus-like elements in the genomes of bats, rodents, shrews, tenrecs and marsupials. Moreover, some filovirus-like elements were transcribed and the detected mammalian elements were homologous to a fragment of the filovirus genome whose expression is known to interfere with the assembly of Ebolavirus. The phylogenetic evidence strongly indicated that the direction of transfer was from virus to mammal. Eutherians other than bats, rodents, and insectivores (i.e., the candidate reservoir taxa for filoviruses) were significantly underrepresented in the taxa with detected integrated filovirus-like elements. The existence of orthologous filovirus-like elements shared among mammalian genera whose divergence dates have been estimated suggests that filoviruses are at least tens of millions of years old. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that filovirus infections have been recorded as paleoviral elements in the genomes of small mammals despite extranuclear replication and a requirement for cooption of reverse transcriptase. Our results show that the mammal-filovirus association is ancient and has resulted in candidates for functional gene products (RNA or protein).},

Methods: We classified cases as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Minist{\`{e}}re de la Sant{\'{e}} Publique. We investigated all cases to obtain demographic characteristics, determine possible exposures, describe signs and symptoms, and identify contacts to be followed up for 21 days. We also estimated the reproduction number and projected number of cases for the 4-week period from May 25, to June 21, 2018. Findings: As of May 30, 2018, 50 cases (37 confirmed, 13 probable) of Zaire ebolavirus were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 21 (42{\%}) were reported in Bikoro, 25 (50{\%}) in Iboko, and four (8{\%}) in Wangata health zones. Wangata is part of Mbandaka, the urban capital of {\'{E}}quateur Province, which is connected to major national and international transport routes. By May 30, 2018, 25 deaths from Ebola virus disease had been reported, with a case fatality ratio of 56{\%} (95{\%} CI 39–72) after adjustment for censoring. This case fatality ratio is consistent with estimates for the 2014–16 west African Ebola virus disease epidemic (p=0{\textperiodcentered}427). The median age of people with confirmed or probable infection was 40 years (range 8–80) and 30 (60{\%}) were male. The most commonly reported signs and symptoms in people with confirmed or probable Ebola virus disease were fever (40 [95{\%}] of 42 cases), intense general fatigue (37 [90{\%}] of 41 cases), and loss of appetite (37 [90{\%}] of 41 cases). Gastrointestinal symptoms were frequently reported, and 14 (33{\%}) of 43 people reported haemorrhagic signs. Time from illness onset and hospitalisation to sample testing decreased over time. By May 30, 2018, 1458 contacts had been identified, of which 746 (51{\%}) remained under active follow-up. The estimated reproduction number was 1{\textperiodcentered}03 (95{\%} credible interval 0{\textperiodcentered}83–1{\textperiodcentered}37) and the cumulative case incidence for the outbreak by June 21, 2018, is projected to be 78 confirmed cases (37–281), assuming heterogeneous transmissibility. Interpretation: The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks. Early detection, rapid patient isolation, contact tracing, and the ongoing vaccination programme should sufficiently control the outbreak. The forecast of the number of cases does not exceed the current capacity to respond if the epidemiological situation does not change. The information presented, although preliminary, has been essential in guiding the ongoing investigation and response to this outbreak. Funding: None.},

abstract = {Harvesting, consumption and trade of bushmeat are important causes of both biodiversity loss and potential zoonotic disease emergence. In order to identify possible ways to mitigate these threats, it is essential to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which bushmeat gets from the site of capture to the consumer's table. In this paper we highlight the previously unrecognized scale of hunting of the African straw-colored fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, a species which is important in both ecological and public health contexts, and describe the commodity chain in southern Ghana for its trade. Based on interviews with 551 Ghanaians, including bat hunters, vendors and consumers, we estimate that a minimum of 128,000 E. helvum bats are sold each year through a commodity chain stretching up to 400. km and involving multiple vendors. Unlike the general bushmeat trade in Ghana, where animals are sold in both specialized bushmeat markets and in restaurants, E. helvum is sold primarily in marketplaces; many bats are also kept by hunters for personal consumption. The offtake estimated in this paper raises serious conservation concerns, while the commodity chain identified in this study may offer possible points for management intervention. The separation of the E. helvum commodity chain from that of other bushmeat highlights the need for species-specific research in this area, particularly for bats, whose status as bushmeat is largely unknown. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2008-09, evidence of Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) infection was found in domestic pigs and pig workers in the Philippines. With species of bats having been shown to be the cryptic reservoir of filoviruses elsewhere, the Philippine government, in conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, assembled a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional team to investigate Philippine bats as the possible reservoir of RESTV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The team undertook surveillance of bat populations at multiple locations during 2010 using both serology and molecular assays.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 464 bats from 21 species were sampled. We found both molecular and serologic evidence of RESTV infection in multiple bat species. RNA was detected with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in oropharyngeal swabs taken from Miniopterus schreibersii, with three samples yielding a product on conventional hemi-nested PCR whose sequences differed from a Philippine pig isolate by a single nucleotide. Uncorroborated qPCR detections may indicate RESTV nucleic acid in several additional bat species (M. australis, C. brachyotis and Ch. plicata). We also detected anti-RESTV antibodies in three bats (Acerodon jubatus) using both Western blot and ELISA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ebolavirus infection is taxonomically widespread in Philippine bats, but the evident low prevalence and low viral load warrants expanded surveillance to elaborate the findings, and more broadly, to determine the taxonomic and geographic occurrence of ebolaviruses in bats in the region.},

abstract = {Infectious disease ecology has recently raised its public profile beyond the scientific community due to the major threats that wildlife infections pose to biological conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security. As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.},

abstract = {Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans. Understanding how these infections filter through ecological systems to cause disease in humans is of profound importance to public health. Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts. For many emerging bat viruses, spillover also requires viral shedding from bats, and survival of the virus in the environment. Focusing on Hendra virus, but also addressing Nipah virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus and coronaviruses, we delineate this cross-species spillover dynamic from the within-host processes that drive virus excretion to land-use changes that increase interaction among species. We describe how land-use changes may affect co-occurrence and contact between bats and recipient hosts. Two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations: episodic shedding from persistently infected bats or transient epidemics that occur as virus is transmitted among bat populations. Management of livestock also may affect the probability of exposure and disease. Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility.},

By March 30, cases had been reported in Foya district in neighboring Liberia (1), and in May, the first cases identified in Sierra Leone were reported. As of June 18, the outbreak was the largest EVD outbreak ever documented, with a combined total of 528 cases (including laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspected cases) and 337 deaths (case-fatality rate = 64{\%}) reported in the three countries. The largest previous outbreak occurred in Uganda during 2000-2001, when 425 cases were reported with 224 deaths (case-fatality rate = 53{\%}). The current outbreak also represents the first outbreak of EVD in West Africa (a single case caused by Ta{\"{i}} Forest virus was reported in C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire in 1994 [3]) and marks the first time that Ebola virus transmission has been reported in a capital city.},

We developed a statistical modeling approach that associates 37 human or great ape Ebola spillovers since 1982 with spatiotemporally dynamic covariates including vegetative cover, human population size, and absolute and relative rainfall over 3 decades across sub-Saharan Africa. Our model (area under the curve 0.80 on test data) shows that spillover intensity is highest during transitions between wet and dry seasons; overall, high seasonal intensity occurs over much of tropical Africa; and spillover intensity is greatest at high ({\textgreater}1,000/km(2)) and very low ({\textless}100/km(2)) human population densities compared with intermediate levels. These results suggest strong seasonality in Ebola spillover from wild reservoirs and indicate particular times and regions for targeted surveillance.},

abstract = {In the past decade the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV) has emerged repeatedly into human populations in central Africa and caused massive die-offs of gorillas and chimpanzees. We tested the view that emergence events are independent and caused by ZEBOV variants that have been long resident at each locality. Phylogenetic analyses place the earliest known outbreak at Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo, very near to the root of the ZEBOV tree, suggesting that viruses causing all other known outbreaks evolved from a Yambuku-like virus after 1976. The tendency for earlier outbreaks to be directly ancestral to later outbreaks suggests that outbreaks are epidemiologically linked and may have occurred at the front of an advancing wave. While the ladder-like phylogenetic structure could also bear the signature of positive selection, our statistical power is too weak to reach a conclusion in this regard. Distances among outbreaks indicate a spread rate of about 50 km per year that remains consistent across spatial scales. Viral evolution is clocklike, and sequences show a high level of small-scale spatial structure. Genetic similarity decays with distance at roughly the same rate at all spatial scales. Our analyses suggest that ZEBOV has recently spread across the region rather than being long persistent at each outbreak locality. Controlling the impact of Ebola on wild apes and human populations may be more feasible than previously recognized.},

For decades the identity of the natural reservoir was unknown. However, in 2007 Marburg viruses were isolated directly from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) that inhabited a Ugandan gold mine where miners were previously infected. Soon after, two tourists became infected with Marburg virus after visiting nearby Python Cave, a popular attraction in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. This cave also contained R. aegyptiacus bats (∼40,000 animals). These events prompted a long-term investigation of Python Cave to determine if, 1) R. aegyptiacus in the cave carried infectious Marburg virus genetically similar to that found in the tourists, and 2) what ecological factors might influence virus spillover to humans. In the study, we found that, 1) approximately 2.5{\%} of the bat colony is actively infected at any one time and that virus isolates from bats are genetically similar to those from infected tourists, and 2) specific age groups of bats (juveniles∼six months of age) are particularly likely to be infected at specific times of the year that roughly coincide with historical dates of Marburg virus spillover into humans.},

Recently, bats of multiple species have been identified as possible natural hosts of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) in Gabon and Republic of Congo, and also of marburgvirus (MARV) in Gabon and Democratic Republic of Congo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We tested 2147 bats belonging to at least nine species sampled between 2003 and 2008 in three regions of Gabon and in the Ebola epidemic region of north Congo for IgG antibodies specific for ZEBOV and MARV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Overall, IgG antibodies to ZEBOV and MARV were found in 4{\%} and 1{\%} of bats, respectively. ZEBOV-specific antibodies were found in six bat species (Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, Myonycteris torquata, Micropteropus pusillus, Mops condylurus and Rousettus aegyptiacus), while MARV-specific antibodies were only found in Rousettus aegyptiacus and Hypsignathus monstrosus. The prevalence of MARV-specific IgG was significantly higher in R. aegyptiacus members captured inside caves than elsewhere. No significant difference in prevalence was found according to age or gender. A higher prevalence of ZEBOV-specific IgG was found in pregnant females than in non pregnant females.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These findings confirm that ZEBOV and MARV co-circulate in Gabon, the only country where bats infected by each virus have been found. IgG antibodies to both viruses were detected only in Rousettus aegyptiacus, suggesting that this bat species may be involved in the natural cycle of both Marburg and Ebola viruses. The presence of MARV in Gabon indicates a potential risk for a first human outbreak. Disease surveillance should be enhanced in areas near caves.},

To better understand the factors that create an AIV hotspot, we developed and parametrized a mechanistic transmission model to study the simultaneous epizootiological impacts of multi-species transmission, seasonal breeding, host migration and mixed transmission routes. We scrutinized our model to examine the potential for an AIV hotspot to serve as a 'gateway' for the spread of novel viruses into North America. Our findings identify the conditions under which a novel influenza virus, if introduced into the system, could successfully invade and proliferate.},

After four decades of Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) outbreaks in Central Africa, the virus was detected for the first time in West Africa in 2014. To better understand the role of fruit bats as potential reservoirs and circulating hosts between Central and West Africa, we examine here the phylogeny and comparative phylogeography of Pteropodidae. Our phylogenetic results confirm the existence of four independent lineages of African fruit bats: the genera Eidolon and Rousettus, and the tribes Epomophorini and Scotonycterini, and indicate that the three species suspected to represent ZEBOV reservoir hosts (Epomops franqueti, Hypsignathus monstrosus, and Myonycteris torquata) belong to an African clade that diversified rapidly around 8-7 Mya. To test for phylogeographic structure and for recent gene flow from Central to West Africa, we analysed the nucleotide variation of 675 cytochrome b gene (Cytb) sequences, representing eight fruit bat species collected in 48 geographic localities. Within Epomophorina, our mitochondrial data do not support the monophyly of two genera (Epomops and Epomophorus) and four species (Epomophorus gambianus, Epomops franqueti, Epomops buettikoferi, and Micropteropus pusillus). In Epomops, however, we found two geographic haplogroups corresponding to the Congo Basin and Upper Guinea forests, respectively. By contrast, we found no genetic differentiation between Central and West African populations for all species known to make seasonal movements, Eidolon helvum, E. gambianus, H. monstrosus, M. pusillus, Nanonycteris veldkampii, and Rousettus aegyptiacus. Our results suggest that only three fruit bat species were able to disperse directly ZEBOV from the Congo Basin to Upper Guinea: E. helvum, H. monstrosus, and R. aegyptiacus.},

abstract = {Models for infectious diseases usually assume a fixed demographic structure. Yet, a disease can spread over a region encountering different local demographic variations that may significantly alter local dynamics. Spatial heterogeneity in the resulting dynamics can lead to important differences in the design of surveillance and control strategies. We illustrate this by exploring the north-south gradient in the seasonal demography of raccoon rabies over the eastern USA. We find that the greater variance in the timing of spring births characteristic of southern populations can lead to the spatial synchronization of southern epidemics, while the narrow birth-pulse associated with northern populations can lead to an irregular patchwork of epidemics. These results indicate that surveillance in the southern states can be reduced relative to northern locations without loss of detection ability. This approach could yield significant savings in vaccination programmes. The importance of seasonality in many widely distributed diseases indicates that our findings will find applications beyond raccoon rabies.},

abstract = {Filoviruses Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV) cause haemorrhagic fevers with high mortality rates, posing significant threats to public health. To understand transmission into human populations, filovirus dynamics within reservoir host populations must be understood. Studies have directly linked filoviruses to bats, but the mechanisms allowing viral persistence within bat populations are poorly understood. Theory suggests seasonal birthing may decrease the probability of pathogen persistence within populations, but data suggest MARV may persist within colonies of seasonally breeding Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus. I synthesize available filovirus and bat data in a stochastic compartmental model to explore fundamental questions relating to filovirus ecology: can filoviruses persist within isolated bat colonies; do critical community sizes exist; and how do host-pathogen relationships affect spillover transmission potential? Synchronous annual breeding and shorter incubation periods did not allow filovirus persistence, whereas bi-annual breeding and longer incubation periods, such as reported for Egyptian fruit bats and EBOV in experimental studies, allowed persistence in colony sizes often found in nature. Serological data support the findings, with bats from species with two annual birth pulses more likely to be seropositive (odds ratio (OR) 4.4, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 2.5-8.7) than those with one, suggesting that biannual birthing is necessary for filovirus persistence.},

abstract = {Old World frugivorous bats have been identified as natural hosts for emerging zoonotic viruses of significant public health concern, including henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra virus), Ebola virus, and Marburg virus. Epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics, with particular attention paid to juveniles, whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes. However, little is understood about bat immunology, including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates. Understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations, which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans. We conducted two separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1) canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus; and 2) Hendra virus in wild-caught, naturally infected Pteropus alecto. Both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses. We found that in both species, antibodies were transferred from dam to pup. In P. hypomelanus pups, titers against CDV waned over a mean period of 228.6 days (95{\%} CI: 185.4-271.8) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 96.0 days (CI 95{\%}: 30.7-299.7). In P. alecto pups, antibodies waned over 255.13 days (95{\%} CI: 221.0-289.3) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 52.24 days (CI 95{\%}: 33.76-80.83). Each species showed a duration of transferred maternal immunity of between 7.5 and 8.5 months, which was longer than has been previously estimated. These data will allow for more accurate interpretation of age-related Henipavirus serological data collected from wild pteropid bats.},

Taxonomic data is becoming increasingly available on the web, but scientists need a way to access it in a programmatic fashion that's easy and reproducible. We have developed taxize, an open-source software package (freely available from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxize/index.html) for the R language. taxize provides simple, programmatic access to taxonomic data for 13 data sources around the web. We discuss the need for a taxonomic toolbelt in R, and outline a suite of use cases for which taxize is ideally suited (including a full workflow as an appendix). The taxize package facilitates open and reproducible science by allowing taxonomic data collection to be done in the open-source R platform.},

abstract = {Ebola and other filoviruses pose significant public health and conservation threats by causing high mortality in primates, including humans. Preventing future outbreaks of ebolavirus depends on identifying wildlife reservoirs, but extraordinarily high biodiversity of potential hosts in temporally dynamic environments of equatorial Africa contributes to sporadic, unpredictable outbreaks that have hampered efforts to identify wild reservoirs for nearly 40 years. Using a machine learning algorithm, generalized boosted regression, we characterize potential filovirus-positive bat species with estimated 87 {\%} accuracy. Our model produces two specific outputs with immediate utility for guiding filovirus surveillance in the wild. First, we report a profile of intrinsic traits that discriminates hosts from non-hosts, providing a biological caricature of a filovirus-positive bat species. This profile emphasizes traits describing adult and neonate body sizes and rates of reproductive fitness, as well as species' geographic range overlap with regions of high mammalian diversity. Second, we identify several bat species ranked most likely to be filovirus-positive on the basis of intrinsic trait similarity with known filovirus-positive bats. New bat species predicted to be positive for filoviruses are widely distributed outside of equatorial Africa, with a majority of species overlapping in Southeast Asia. Taken together, these results spotlight several potential host species and geographical regions as high-probability targets for future filovirus surveillance. Author Summary Preventing future outbreaks of ebolaviruses in humans and other vulnerable animal populations will require identifying the natural reservoirs of filoviruses. Accumulating indirect evidence points to certain bat species as prime suspects. To guide the search for natural filovirus reservoirs, we mined intrinsic biological data on the world's bat species to determine what features best predict filovirus hosts compared to bats at large. We report a suite of traits that distinguishes seropositive bat species from all others with an estimated 87 {\%} accuracy. We also identify several bat species not currently known to be filovirus hosts whose trait profiles indicate should be surveillance targets. Geographic regions where numerous potential filovirus hosts co-occur (potential filovirus hotspots) suggest that filovirus distribution and diversity may be greater than previously thought.},

abstract = {A large outbreak of haemorrhagic fever (subsequently named Ebola haemorrhagic fever) occurred in southern Sudan between June and November 1976. There was a total of 284 cases; 67 in the source town of Nzara, 213 in Maridi, 3 in Tembura, and 1 in Juba. The outbreak in Nzara appears to have originated in the workers of a cotton factory. The disease in Maridi was amplified by transmission in a large, active hospital. Transmission of the disease required close contact with an acute case and was usually associated with the act of nursing a patient. The incubation period was between 7 and 14 days. Although the link was not well established, it appears that Nzara could have been the source of infection for a similar outbreak in the Bumba Zone of Zaire.In this outbreak Ebola haemorrhagic fever was a unique clinical disease with a high mortality rate (53{\%} overall) and a prolonged recovery period in those who survived. Beginning with an influenza-like syndrome, including fever, headache, and joint and muscle pains, the disease soon caused diarrhoea (81{\%}), vomiting (59{\%}), chest pain (83{\%}), pain and dryness of the throat (63{\%}), and rash (52{\%}). Haemorrhagic manifestations were common (71{\%}), being present in half of the recovered cases and in almost all the fatal cases.Two post mortems were carried out on patients in November 1976. The histopathological findings resembled those of an acute viral infection and although the features were characteristic they were not exclusively diagnostic. They closely resembled the features described in Marburg virus infection, with focal eosinophilic necrosis in the liver and destruction of lymphocytes and their replacement by plasma cells. One case had evidence of renal tubular necrosis.Two strains of Ebola virus were isolated from acute phase sera collected from acutely ill patients in Maridi hospital during the investigation in November 1976. Antibodies to Ebola virus were detected by immunofluorescence in 42 of 48 patients in Maridi who had been diagnosed clinically, but in only 6 of 31 patients in Nzara. The possibility of the indirect immunofluorescent test not being sufficiently sensitive is discussed.Of Maridi case contacts, in hospital and in the local community, 19{\%} had antibodies. Very few of them gave any history of illness, indicating that Ebola virus can cause mild or even subclinical infections. Of the cloth room workers in the Nzara cotton factory, 37{\%} appeared to have been infected, suggesting that the factory may have been the prime source of infection.},

Since the first outbreak in 1967, their origins, natural history, and ecology remained elusive until recent studies linked them through molecular, serological, and virological studies to bats. We review the ecology, epidemiology, and natural history of these systems, drawing on examples from other bat-borne zoonoses, and highlight key areas for future research. We compare and contrast results from ecological and virological studies of bats and filoviruses with those of other systems. We also highlight how advanced methods, such as more recent serological assays, can be interlinked with flexible statistical methods and experimental studies to inform the field studies necessary to understand filovirus persistence in wildlife populations and cross-species transmission leading to outbreaks. We highlight the need for a more unified, global surveillance strategy for filoviruses in wildlife, and advocate for more integrated, multi-disciplinary approaches to understand dynamics in bat populations to ultimately mitigate or prevent potentially devastating disease outbreaks.},

@article{Fahr2015,
abstract = {Background Straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) migrate over vast distances across the African continent, probably following seasonal bursts of resource availability. This causes enor- mous fluctuations in population size, which in turn may influence the bats' impact on local ecosystems.We studied the movement ecology of this central-place forager with state-of- the-art GPS/acceleration loggers and concurrently monitored the seasonal fluctuation of the colony in Accra, Ghana. Habitat use on the landscape scale was assessed with remote sensing data as well as ground-truthing of foraging areas. Principal Findings During the wet season population low ({\~{}} 4000 individuals), bats foraged locally (3.5–36.7 km) in urban areas with low tree cover. Major food sources during this period were fruits of introduced trees. Foraging distances almost tripled (24.1–87.9 km) during the dry season population peak ({\~{}} 150,000 individuals), but this was not compensated for by reduced rest- ing periods. Dry season foraging areas were random with regard to urban footprint and tree cover, and food consisted almost exclusively of nectar and pollen of native trees. Conclusions and Significance Our study suggests that straw-coloured fruit bats disperse seeds in the range of hundreds of meters up to dozens of kilometres, and pollinate trees for up to 88 km. Straw-coloured fruit bats forage over much larger distances compared to most other Old World fruit bats, thus providing vital ecosystem services across extensive landscapes. We recommend increased efforts aimed at maintaining E. helvum populations throughout Africa since their keystone role in various ecosystems is likely to increase due to the escalating loss of other seed dispersers as well as continued urbanization and habitat fragmentation.

This opportunistic, sit-and-wait predator typically forages from the crowns of Acacia tortilis and captures insects through a broad range of elevations by brief, precise interceptions. Lavia is monogamous. Members of a pair roost together in a territory defended by the male, forage either separately or together, and share the territory for some 3 months with the single young. Acacia tortilis responds to erratic dry-season rains by flowering and growing new leaves; attending brief bursts of insect abundance may be of crucial importance to Lavia during dry-season energy bottlenecks. Many of the most distinctive aspects of the life history of Lavia-monogamy, territoriality, the division of labor, opportunistic foraging, a long mother-young association, and a close association between Lavia and A. tortilis-probably are adaptations to recurring periods of energy stress.},

In both species the gestation period was extended by a period of delayed implantation. In M. fraterculus the period of delayed implantation was two-and-a-half months, one-and-a-half months shorter than this period in M. schreibersi. In both species the period of active fetal growth was approximately four months. Copulation in M. schreibersi from the Natal Midlands began one month after copulation in the same species from southern and northern Transvaal (c. 25{\^{A}}°S and c. 24{\^{A}}°S), and it is suggested that this is the result of summer in the Transvaal ending approximately one month earlier than in the Natal Midlands. On the basis of the reproductive cycle and winter behaviour, the difference between the reproductive cycles of M. schreibersi and M. fraterculus is explained by suggesting that M. fraterculus migrated southwards from the tropics after M. schreibersi, that M. fraterculus has a shorter history at southern latitudes, and as such its reproductive cycle is intermediate between that of M. schreibersi from the same latitude, and the typical tropical reproductive pattern.},

The largest recorded outbreak of EVD is ongoing in West Africa, outside of its previously reported and predicted niche. We assembled location data on all recorded zoonotic transmission to humans and Ebola virus infection in bats and primates (1976-2014). Using species distribution models, these occurrence data were paired with environmental covariates to predict a zoonotic transmission niche covering 22 countries across Central and West Africa. Vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and suspected reservoir bat distributions define this relationship. At-risk areas are inhabited by 22 million people; however, the rarity of human outbreaks emphasises the very low probability of transmission to humans. Increasing population sizes and international connectivity by air since the first detection of EVD in 1976 suggest that the dynamics of human-to-human secondary transmission in contemporary outbreaks will be very different to those of the past.},

M. wroughtoni Andersen, 1908, and M. leptodon Andersen, 1908, are considered synonyms of M. torquata. The subgenus Phygetis Andersen, 1912, proposed for the species brachycephala only, is sunk into the synonymy of Myonycteris. A number of new (collecting) localities for torquata is recorded, among which the first one in Nigeria. Data are included on morphological variability, sexual dimorphism, ecology and biology. The possible type locality of torquata, and some evolutionary trends within the genus are discussed.},

abstract = {Angola free-tailed bats and little free-tailed bats occur in diverse habitats throughout most of Africa south of the Sahara. This study investigated the reproductive strategies and related biology of these species in Malawi where they were sympatric, and analysed data from elsewhere in Africa to show how the strategies varied along a gradient of habitats from approximately 12 degrees N to 25 degrees S. Both the Angola free-tailed bat and the little free-tailed bat were normally monotocous. Angola free-tailed bats invariably had 2 births/year, and the interval between consecutive births decreased with increasing latitude. When the interval was shortest (approximately 90 days) a post-partum oestrus occurred. Little free-tailed bats differed by having a shorter gestation (approximately 60 days), and the ability to have up to 5 births/year with a postpartum oestrus after each birth. The extent to which this potential is achieved varies with latitude and rainfall, mainly so that lactation can coincide with peaks in the abundance of food. The interaction between rainfall and reproductive characteristics results in the two species having patterns of reproduction which are sometimes similar, but more often different. Competition between the species is unlikely to be affected by differences in their reproduction.},

abstract = {The reproduction of 37 species of bats from Malawi was investigated, and the strategies (litter size and chronology) of seven species were determined. Reproduction was then related to rainfall and (if possible) abundance of food. Strategies of Malawian bats were compared with strategies of bats from six other African environments with different patterns of rainfall and availability of food. Monotocous species are numerous and found in all environments, but there are few polytocous species and polytocy has not been recorded in some environments. Ten reproductive chronologies (distinguished by the timing of parturition in relation to season, the presence of reproductive synchrony, the number of pregnancies/year, and the presence or absence of postpartum oestrus) were recognized in African bats. The number and kind of chronologies occurring in different environments is variable. Four chronologies have been recorded in fruit-bats; intraspecific variability is rare, possibly because fluctuations in the abundance of fruit are comparatively small in the environments where most species of fruit-bats are found. Reproductive inflexibility may explain why most fruit-bats do not exploit diverse environments. Eight chronologies have been recorded in insect-eating bats. These bats show more interspecific and intraspecific variability than fruit-bats, probably because seasonal differences in the availability of insects are great enough to impose considerable selective pressure on reproduction. Species capable of reproductive flexibility exploit diverse environments.},

Implantation was delayed until early July and parturition occurred between late October and mid-November, about four months after implantation and six to seven months after fertilization. The timing and length of gestation at 18"s are similar to that described for M. schreibersii from Zaire (11"s) and when these data are compared with those for the same species from higher latitudes in Africa, it is apparent that there is a small, but distinct, increase in the total length of pregnancy and the length of delayed implantation with increasing latitude. The reproductive biology of Miniopterus schreibersii from Africa and France differs fundamentally from that of the same species from Australia and Japan, and it is suggested that studies of the relationship between latitude and duration of delayed implantation should be based on comparisons within single species from different latitudes on the same continent, and that comparisons between species and between continents should be avoided.},

abstract = {In Schreibers' long-fingered bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) from South Africa, implantation is delayed from May to August during which time the corpus luteum is inactive and plasma progesterone and LH concentrations low. Treatment of pregnant long-fingered bats with exogenous prolactin for 10 days in early delayed implantation (May) resulted in changes in luteal ultrastructure that were consistent with increased steroidogenesis, high plasma progesterone concentrations and the initiation of implantation. Treatment of bats with hCG for 10 days in early delayed implantation induced similar changes in luteal ultrastructure and plasma progesterone concentrations, but did not initiate implantation. Treatment with exogenous progesterone during early delayed implantation had no influence on the corpus luteum or the conceptus. We conclude that prolactin is the most important pituitary hormone in the control of delayed implantation, although the route via which it induces implantation is unknown.},

Mating occurred between mid-June and early July, in the middle of the cool, dry season. After mating, spermatozoa were stored by the female until ovulation in August and by the male until at least September. The period of female sperm storage effectively lengthened the reproductive cycle so that early spermatogenesis occurred during the second half of one hot, wet season and births at the beginning of the following hot, wet season. During the period of sperm storage, males and females roosted together and group membership was labile, suggesting that the mating system may be promiscuous (both males and females mating with more than one partner) and that sperm competition may occur. The similarity between the chronology of reproduction in Malawi, Kenya, and South Africa leads us to propose that sperm storage occurs at all three localities},

abstract = {Epomops buettikoferi is a savanna species of fruit bat that has entered the deforested zone in Liberia where it inhabits agricultural areas and secondary forest, but not rain forest. Contrary to the conclusions of Bergmans {\&} Sowler (1992), the species is in no way vulnerable or endangered because of destruction of the Upper Guinea rain forest. Instead, as the remaining Upper Guinea rain forest is cut, it is predicted that numbers of E. buettikoferi will increase. Sexual dimorphism was observed in the pelvic girdle, which by palpation allowed reliable determination of sex (100{\%} accurate) of individuals of any age. This was useful in the field for distinguishing immature males, which lack an obvious penis and epaulettes, from females. In central Liberia, female E. buettikoferi have a bimodal reproductive cycle, with two young borne annually about six months apart. The two births occur in February/March (end of dry/beginning of the wet season) and August/September (during heaviest rains in second half of the wet). Parturition is followed by oestrus, with immediate embryonic development and gestation spanning five to six months. Reproduction is timed so that both periods of lactation occur during the wet season.},

During the dry season, E. helvum roosts in at least one large colony (ca. 500 000 individuals) in the southern forest zone of Ivory Coast. Following the birth of young in February, males and females move into the savanna zones, and the progressive establishment and decline of colonies along a south–north axis indicates that E. helvum migrates at least to the Niger River basin by the middle of the wet season (July). During the dry season, both M. torquata and N. veldkampi are absent from savanna sites, but are common in the forest zone. With the onset of the rainy season in March, catch rates of both species increase first at a southern Guinea savanna site and subsequently at a savanna site 400 km to the north, indicating that both species migrate at least to the southern Sudanese savanna zone during the wet season. Both sexes of N. veldkampi migrate, but the migratio...},

abstract = {Straw-colored fruit bats are found in isolated colonies comprising millions of individuals in many parts of south-western Nigeria. Roosts are usually situated in groves and thickets close to human habitation, local shrines and marshy areas, which offer sanctuary to the bats. The trees most favored for roosting were those that project above the surrounding vegetation. The straw-colored fruit bat is nocturnal, feeding mainly between 1900 and 0630 h. The diet consists almost exclusively of a variety of ripe succulent fruits and floral parts. Mating and fertilization occur mainly in May to July with about 57-91{\%} of females being pregnant in a breeding season but the fertilized egg does not get implanted until about Nov.-Dec. Young are born in March to May at 39-60 g body wt. Each mother continuously carries about her single baby until June or July when the baby is weaned at 120-150 g body wt. E. helvum is important in the local economy as its roosting activities cause extensive mechanical damage to some economically inportant trees like oil palm (Eleasis guineensis) and Iroko (Chlorophora excelsa). Consumption of fruits like mango, pawpaw, guava, plantain and banana cause yield losses and qualitative devaluation of many fruits. Feces from thousands of bats cause much filth and stench in the environment of some roosts and beneath feeding trees while the clamour of bats in roosts or while feeding near human habitation is very exasperating. Bats are an important item of the diet in all localities where they occur. They also serve as pollinating agents for a number of trees in the families Moraceae and Bombaceae.},

abstract = {This study deals with 272 Megachiroptera from the People's Republic of Congo, belonging to 13 taxa: Eidolon helvum helvum (Kerr), Rousettus aegyptiacus unicolor (Gray), Lissonycteris angolensis angolensis (Bocage), Myonycteris torquata (Dobson), Hypsignathus monstrosus Allen, Epomops franqueti franqueti (Tomes), Epomophorus cf. labiatus (Temminck), Epomophorus wahlbergi haldemani (Halowell), Micropteropus grandis Sanborn, Micropteropus pusillus (Peters), Scotonycteris zenkeri zenkeri Matschie, Scotonycteris ophiodon Pohle, and Megaloglossus woermanni Pagenstecher. Of these, Epomophorus cf. labiatus and Micropteropus grandis are recorded from this country for the first time. The known ranges of Epomophorus cf. labiatus and Micropteropus grandis are greatly extended towards the west. In morphology and zoogeography ten species correspond with populations to the north and, with the possible exception of both Scotonycteris species, to the south; towards the east the distribution of Rousettus aegyptiacus and both Scotonycteris species is possibly discontinuous. The two Epomophorus species and Micropteropus grandis are linked with populations towards the south and east only. Seasonal biannual reproduction is assumed for Epomophorus wahlbergi Epomops franqueti, and Micropteropus pusillus. Data on reproduction in other species are scarce or lacking.},

abstract = {The bat fauna of a south-central Kenya study area was monitored from May 1973 to July 1974. Bats in 7 families [Pteropodidae, Emballonuridae, Nycteridae, Megadermatidae, Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae and Molossidae] were collected. This fauna is depauperate compared to Neotropical areas due to a lack of non-insectivorous feeders. The number of species and families of insect eating bats is nearly identical to that found at a Costa Rican site with a similar climate sampled in a comparable manner. The area had a pronounced dry season from May to late Oct., 2 rainy seasons in Nov. and March-April, and a short and less severe dry season from Dec. through Feb. The maximum number of species was detected from Nov. to May. About 1/2 of these species were found during the long dry season, and many of those present seemed to occur in lower densities. Seasonal migration to areas with complementary rainfall patterns account for these differences. All but 1 sp. reproduced with the more predictable Nov. rains; a few also gave birth in the March-April rainy season; none bred in the long dry season. Most annual residents bred only in Nov. and most of those species which gave birth in March-April probably were migratory. Suspected migrants tended towards smaller litter sizes. Several foraging-related characters were examined as indicators of food resources partitioning. The aspect ratio was significantly correlated with estimates of foraging height. Most of the common non-molossid insectivorous bat species may coexist on the basis of differences in pursuit strategy, prey size orientation pulses or feeding heights. A greater proportion of coexisting species overlap in size during Nov.-May than during the long dry season. This may indicate a greater degree of selective feeding when insect abundance is high, and greater partitioning on the basis of size when abundance is low.},

@article{Cotterill1999,
abstract = {The annual cycle and reproductive ecology of a large population of Commerson's leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros commersoni, was studied in central Zimbabwe. The influence of the extremely large body size of this microchiropteran, interrelating with a seasonal, tropical environment. was the central theme of this study. Adaptive responses to seasonal environmental changes differed between reproducing adults of the sexes. Reproductive females dispersed twice during the annual cycle, while in contrast adult mates reduced activity during the cool, dry season. A polygynous mating system was characterised by breeding males defending demarcated territories within the daylight roost. Synchronized parturitions within maternity roosts (in late October) created a hot, humid microclimate which facilitated rapid post-natal development of neonates. The large body size of H. commersoni is suggested to have evolved in response to different selective agents, including: availability of large, hard shelled arthropods as prey; energetic constraints; and availability of fat reserves to 'ride out' inclement periods when food is limiting. Sexual selection may be the ultimate cause of a large body size. The conservation of H. commersoni is discussed given the history and pressures for guano exploitation of their breeding caves and the keystone role of these large bats in transferring nutrients and energy into the cavernicolous ecosystems where they roost and breed.},

abstract = {Female reproduction and the female reproductive cycle of Hipposideros caffer from three disused mines in Natal (c. 29 {\`{I}}?S) are described. The uterus of H. caffer was bicornuate with sinistral structural and functional asymmetry. The corpus uteri and caudal ends of the uterine horns differed from the general mammalian pattern, being lined by stratified epithelium. Growth, development and atresia of ovarian follicles were typically mammalian. The corpus luteum of H. caffer, which was extruded from the ovary, disappeared within one month of ovulation. H. caffer was monoestrous and monotocous. Follicular development began in February, with copulation and ovulation occurring in late April (early winter). The gestation period was estimated to have been approximately 220 days of which the period of the zygote accounted for 21 days or 9,5 per cent, the period of the embryo 123 days or 55,9 per cent and the period of the foetus 76 days or 34,5 per cent. Development from fertilization to implantation was normal but embryonic development was retarded during winter. Parturition occurred in early December and was followed by a period of lactation/anoestrus during December and January. The oestrous cycle, including pregnancy, was characterised by a relatively long pregnancy stage and the absence of a separate period of anoestrus. H. caffer did not hibernate throughout the winter period but entered short periods of torpor during particularly cold spells. Results from the present study support the trend seen in the genus Hipposideros and other microchiropteran genera of increasing gestation length with increasing latitude.},

abstract = {We present the results of the first survey of the fruit bats of the Lesio-Louna Reserve in the Republic of Congo, an area representative of the larger Bateke Plateau region of the country. Mist-netting was conducted in 2002 during four seasonal sampling periods: late wet season, early dry season, late dry season and early wet season. Five species were recorded. Two were frequently trapped, Micropteropus pusillus (n=102 individuals) and Epomops franqueti (n=57). The remaining three were captured only occasionally, Myonycteris torquata (n=5), Hypsignathus monstrosus (n=2) and Megaloglossus woermanni (n=2). In agreement with studies of other fauna, our results confirm that the Bateke Plateau supports species associated with both forest and savanna habitats. However, species typical of forested habitats were also netted in forest edge and neighbouring savanna, suggesting that these species utilise surrounding habitat within the forest-savanna mosaic characteristic of the study area. We found statistically significant seasonal variation in juvenile body mass and forearm length in E. franqueti and in adult female nipple length in M. pusillus, suggesting breeding seasonality in both these species in the reserve.},

abstract = {The reproductive pattern of the female Angolan free-tailed bat Mops condylurus (A. Smith, 1933) was investigated at two localities in Mpumalanga. Female Angolan free-tailed bats displayed a seasonal bimodally polyoestrous reproductive pattern. Parturition in December was followed closely by a postpartum oestrus. Ovarian follicle and endometrium cycles also closely followed the breeding season. The reproductive tract displayed complete dextral dominance with the right ovary and uterus being functionally dominant. Luteal activity was maintained throughout pregnancy and healthy corpora lutea were observed until late in pregnancy. Shedding of the zona pellucida occurred in the oviduct in the region of the ampulla-isthmus junction. The embryo entered the uterus as a morula, where it was transformed into a unilaminar, free-lying blastocyst. A unique feature of the pre-implantation uterus was the formation of a distinct decidua at the implantation site on the mesometrial side. Implantation in the Angolan free-tailed bat was centric and superficial. First attachment of the trophoblast to the endometrium was mesometrial. The formation of a pre-placental pad of trophoblast cells was also initiated on the mesometrial side, while orientation of the embryonic disc was anti-mesometrial. Placental development occurred in the abembryonic hemisphere. Proliferation of the trophoblast over the embryonic hemisphere was slow and a bilaminar arrangement of the trophoblast was not observed in this region until after the primitive streak stage.},

abstract = {Many infectious agents, especially those that cause emerging diseases, infect more than one host species. Managing reservoirs of multihost pathogens often plays a crucial role in effective disease control. However, reservoirs remain variously and loosely defined. We propose that reservoirs can only be understood with reference to defined target populations. Therefore, we define a reservoir as one or more epidemiologically connected populations or environments in which the pathogen can be permanently maintained and from which infection is transmitted to the defined target population. Existence of a reservoir is confirmed when infection within the target population cannot be sustained after all transmission between target and nontarget populations has been eliminated. When disease can be controlled solely by interventions within target populations, little knowledge of potentially complex reservoir infection dynamics is necessary for effective control. We discuss the practical value of different approaches that may be used to identify reservoirs in the field.},
